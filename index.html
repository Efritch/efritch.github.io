        <p>My name is Erik and I always like to learn new things. My wife, Sarah, and I have three children that keep us very busy. Each of them have their own curiousities that they love to explore. Their names are Elsa, Norah, and Callum. We live in Indiana and enjoy the different seasons that occur. But, the kids do wish we had more snow. Some of the activites we like to do are:
        <ul>
            <li>hiking</li>
            <li>riding bikes</li>
            <li>cooking/baking</li>
            <li>golf</li>
            <li>snow skiing & sledding</li>
            <li>soccer</li>
            <li>water sports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also enjoy working with my hands. Some of these hobbies are woodworking, building/inventing, legos, and gardening. I and my family also like to watch college football on Saturdays. I and my oldest daughter are fans of the Michigan Wolverines, while my wife and youngest daughter are fans of the Ohio State Buckeyes. Despite the rivalry we keep a happy home. As evidenced by the above picture, I am also a fan of Formula 1 racing. I am most impressed by the skill some of the drivers have to consistently outperform the rest of the field. While I enjoy some enthusiastic driving, I do my best to remember that I am not on a closed track.

        <p>I am on a few social media platforms but not many. I don't want to spend too much time in front of a screen.
